# Simple ML algorithms, which everybody should know

## Supervised pizzas

The file [pizzas list](../datasets/pizzas.txt) contains 30 lines of data.</br> Each is an example, composed of an input variable (the reservations) and a numerical label (the pizzas). Once we have an algorithm, we can use these examples to train it.

``` python 0_supervised_pizzas.py
```
